# AI for Food Allergies – Dataset Collection Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to collect, organize, and document datasets relevant to the application of artificial intelligence in the study of food allergies.  
The immediate goal is to build a **centralized and accessible resource** for researchers, as knowledge and datasets in this field are currently scattered across multiple sources.  

Each dataset will be complemented with a **short report** summarizing existing research and its relevance to food allergy applications.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Identify and document datasets across selected categories.  
- Provide concise literature reports for each dataset category.  
- Facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing within the community.  

---

## 📂 Focus Areas  
We will begin by exploring three high-priority themes:  

### 1. 🏥 Early Detection & Diagnosis  
- AI for predicting risk of food allergies using clinical and genomic data.  
- **Example Dataset:** FARE Patient Registry.  

### 2. 🧬 Drug Design  
- AI-assisted immunotherapy development using protein structure analysis.  
- **Example Datasets:** Protein Data Bank (PDB), Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP).  

### 3. 🌿 Food Engineering  
- AI for creating hypoallergenic foods by modifying allergenic epitopes.  
- **Example Resource:** [AgroNT – Plant Genome Model](https://instadeep.com/research/paper/a-large-language-foundational-model-for-edible-plant-genomes/).

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines  
- Work in groups of 2–3 people per category.  
- Collect relevant datasets and provide references.  
- Write a brief report on established research and applications for your assigned category.  

---

## 📅 Next Steps  
- Complete dataset collection and reports for the three categories by the end of the week.  
- A follow-up meeting will be scheduled to present findings and discuss results.
